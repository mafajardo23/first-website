<h2>Some facts about me...</h2>

    <h2>Why I am taking this course:</h2>
    I recently started to work with the <b>Hack@Davidson Hackathon </b>for the marketing department updating their website so all of this information is useful. Additionally, <b>I have always had a passion for design.</b>
    
    
    <h2>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h2>
    I took a <b>Cryptography</b> course junior year and I learned some python. Then I took a java class and learned the basics. Now I just started with the Hackathon team learning a little about <b>Git</b> and these different libraries but I am definitely a <b>beginner</b>.
    
    
    <h2>What are your goals in this course?</h2>
    My goals for this course are to be confident in creating even a simple web page. To understand Web Design a little more and to think critically about the experience of the user.
