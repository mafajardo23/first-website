<h2>Why I am taking this course:</h2>
I recently started to work with the <b>Hack@Davidson Hackathon </b>for the marketing department updating their website so all of this information is useful. Additionally, <b>I have always had a passion for design.</b>
    
<h2>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h2>
I took a <b>Cryptography</b> course junior year and I learned some python. Then I took a java class and learned the basics. Now I just started with the Hackathon team learning a little about <b>Git</b> and these different libraries but I am definitely a <b>beginner</b>.
    
<h2>What are your goals in this course?</h2>
My goals for this course are to be confident in creating even a simple web page. To understand Web Design a little more and to think critically about the experience of the user.
    
<h3>Learn Computing Tutorial: The Filesystems</h3>
<p>The main directory in a computer is called the root. You create what is called a virtual identity and that will give you different permissions. Who can edit and open each files depends on the user and the permissions available. Folders are the way we organize those files. Programs like apps are also files that have others within them so they can run. Files are the way each computer stores different information like text and editing files. The file extension at the end of the file name will let the user know for what it's used for. For example Drawing.psd or image.jpg. To locate a file you turn to the path. The most important commands are “cd”, “~/” to go back to the main path, “pwd” to see your current directory, and “ls” to view the listed files. Hidden files are a type of files that are not “there” but the computer still uses them.</p>
