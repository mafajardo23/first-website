<h2>Some facts about me...</h2>

<h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I am a <small>freshman</small></li>
        <li>My intended major is Computer Science</li>
        <li>My intended minor is Digital Studies</li>
      </ul> 
    </h4>
    
    
<h2>Why I am taking this course:</h2>
I recently started to work with the <b>Hack@Davidson Hackathon </b>for the marketing department updating their website so all of this information is useful. Additionally, <b>I have always had a passion for design.</b>
    
<h2>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h2>
I took a <b>Cryptography</b> course junior year and I learned some python. Then I took a java class and learned the basics. Now I just started with the Hackathon team learning a little about <b>Git</b> and these different libraries but I am definitely a <b>beginner</b>.
    
<h2>What are your goals in this course?</h2>
My goals for this course are to be confident in creating even a simple web page. To understand Web Design a little more and to think critically about the experience of the user.
    
<h3>Learn Computing Tutorial: The Filesystems</h3>
<p>The main directory in a computer is called the root. You create what is called a virtual identity and that will give you different permissions. Who can edit and open each files depends on the user and the permissions available. Folders are the way we organize those files. Programs like apps are also files that have others within them so they can run. Files are the way each computer stores different information like text and editing files. The file extension at the end of the file name will let the user know for what it's used for. For example Drawing.psd or image.jpg. To locate a file you turn to the path. The most important commands are “cd”, “~/” to go back to the main path, “pwd” to see your current directory, and “ls” to view the listed files. Hidden files are a type of files that are not “there” but the computer still uses them.</p>

<ul>
    1. Who is currently logged-in?
        <li>Owen Mundy</li>
    2. What is the name of the root directory on this filesystem?
        <li>owenmundy </li>
    3. When was the file last edited?
        <li>July 27, 2021 at 12:30 PM</li>
    4. Where is the user's home directory?
        <li>Mac HD</li>
    5. What is the full path to the image that is shown?
        <li> Mac HD >  Users › owenmundy › Downloads › i-love-organizing.jpg</li>
    6. How much space is available on this computer?
        <li>137.27 GB</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Web-Based Projects</h3>

<p>I hadn't seen this before but I found it hilarious. I started reading the letter and it sounded so weird but I guess someone could've written that? But then I watched the video. I think its fun how people join each other for a common goal over the internet. Like for example the instagram egg.</p>

<p>I love that with web design and development you can create silly little projects but they actually helped improve your skills. And the best aspect about these projects is that you get to share them and be proud of them. I am excited to imagine something and actually being able to create it. That's why I love coding, for me its about being creative and innovative.</p>

<p>Again, its all about collaboration. I used to be very independent but now I love and enjoy working with people for people. This project can be very useful and I like to think about this person had other people in mind when developing and posting this project.</p>

<h2>Done!</h2>

<!--The assignments was very fun and I liked that I was able to apply all the information previosuly learned and practice the routine of editing and commiting changes. In the plart of the learn-computing tutorials, I kept clicking the image and that took me to some code and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to click but then I found the button that took me to the actual file with instructions so all was well.>
